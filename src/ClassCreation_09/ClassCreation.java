    /*

    Classes are like recipes. They tell you what ingredients you need (attributes)
    and what steps to follow (methods) to make something yummy (an object).

    Constructors are like the first steps in the recipe. They're the part where you gather
    your ingredients and start preparing. They make sure everything is ready before you start cooking.

    So, if you have a recipe (class) for making cookies, the constructor is like gathering
    the flour, sugar, and eggs (attributes) and getting your mixing bowl ready before you start
    mixing everything together to bake your cookies (create your object).
